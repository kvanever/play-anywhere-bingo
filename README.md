#### By Kevin VanEvery, Meaghan Jones, Shaath Shatha, Bang Nguyen

## Description

Play Bing Anywhere is a twist to traditional Bingo. A board is generated from a list of words and players can check the boxes when they have seen or experienced the word in the box. When a player gets five in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) they win!
